PROJECT: E-TICKETING


PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The aim of the project is to provide an electronic ticket for transportation.As of now in SSET, it is inconvinient for many students to go and buy tickets at specified time and bulks of paper are wasted everyday. Many times students face the issue of limitted payment even though we have many options like gpay,phonepay etc.This can eliminate the need for standing in long queues as it can be tedious and fustrating, it can also avoid physical travel.

For all this problems we have come up with  single and simple solution e-Tickets
*Convinience: we can book tickets from any where at any time using network.It saves time and effort for both the parties.
*Accessibility: this is available for 24*7
*Reduce paper usage:As e-tickets are digital it reduces tons of wastage of paper(Promots environmental sustainablity)
*Instant conformation:User recieves instant 
*Reduced risk of loss:As they are stored digitally it reduces the rick of lossing the ticket
*Easier payment:It eliminates physical transaction of currency

WHAT WE LEARNED THROUGH THIS HACKATHON
     As beginners, we were unaware about basics of coding.By participating in this hackathon,we gained knowlegde regarding mainly front end and tried to learn flask for back end.this helped us to accquire skill in html and css.WE CREATED OUR OWN WEBSITE FRONT END ! this motivated us to participate in more hackathons :)

DIFFICULTIES FACED
     - couldn't understand the basics of flask
     -couldn't connect database with the help of flask
     - the learning process took more time than we expected
